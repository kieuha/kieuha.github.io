Scientists around the world have been working tirelessly to find ways to better understand, treat, and eventually eliminate COVID-19 from spreading. SARS-CoV-2, causes COVID-19, is a virus closely related to the virus that causes SARS back in 2001. SARS-CoV-2 was first was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1]. It has quickly spread all over the world. Up till now, the virus has killed over 1 million people worldwide. The virus enters the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth and then travels down toward the lungs. It inflames the lining of the airways. The virus then travels to the lungs and causes the lungs to become inflamed and fill with fluid. This results in a reduction of the oxygen supply to the bloodstream. If oxygen levels in the bloodstream decrease, the heart works harder to supply organs and the rest of the body with enough oxygen to function. Pneumonia can progress into acute respiratory failure; in which case the person may need a ventilator to help them breathe [2].

The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.

Viruses are very interesting. They are not considered as living things until they enter a host and use the host cell machinery to make multiple copies of themselves. Viruses consist of two minimum basic components: a single or double strand of DNA or RNA and a protein-coated membrane called a capsid. Some have proteins such as reverse transcriptase, RNA polymerase, kinases, and proteases. The genetic information is protected inside the capsid. Some viruses have an extra layer that covers the capsid called an envelope. When the virus contacts the host cell, the capsid binds to the receptors on the host cell membrane and it injects its genome into the cell leaving the rest of the virus on the surface. Once inside, the virus forms its proteins (either by itself or by using the host) to control the host cell. 
Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates suggests that the 30-kb genome encodes as many as 29 proteins though not all may be expressed. Coronaviruses possess the largest genomes (26.4–31.7 kb) among all known RNA viruses [3]. The viral genome is shown in the picture below [4]:   
SARS-CoV-2 has 29 711 nucleotides that encode for 29 proteins [4]. These proteins are:
IBV-M SARD-CoV:NSP13 IBV:N TGEV:N TGEV:N IBV:N MHV:NSP2 IBV:N MHV:NSP2 MHV:NSP2 SARS-CoV-ORFG SARS-CoV:N SARS-CoV:NSP1 SARS-CoV-NSP15 SARS-CoV:NSP1 IBV:N MHV: NSP2 IBV:N HCoV-OC43:N IBV:N TGEV:N SARS-CoV-ORF9B IBV:N TGEV:N MHV:NSP2 SARS-CoV-2-NSP8 MHV:N IBV:N SARS-CoV-2-N SARS-CoV:NSP7 SARS-CoV:ORF3A
According to Alla Katsnelson on the article "What do we know about the novel coronavirus’s 29 proteins?", here is what we know so far [5]:

2. 1. S proteins: SARS-CoV-2 has many protein spikes (also called S proteins) covering its outer membrane. The virus may use these spikes to enter the host cells by binding to the receptor ACE2 and hack its way to the host cells. The SAR-CoV-2's spikes share 80% of its residues with SARS.  
2. 4 proteins make up the viral’s actual structure
3. 25 coronavirus proteins regulates how the virus assembles copies of itself and how it sneaks past the host immune system.

Proteins are made of amino acid sequences. The chemical properties of the amino acids determine the biological activity of the proteins. They have four levels of organization: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary, the simplest level of protein, is the sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure refers to the interactions between the polypeptide chains to form an alpha helix or beta-pleated sheets. In the tertiary structure, the primary interactions are between R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein. The fourth protein structure is quaternary. Two or more tertiary structures (subunits) interact with each other to make a quaternary structure. Not all proteins have this level of protein structure.

Although there is much unknown information that we have not yet to know about the virus, what we have learned so far has been phenomenal. 10 years ago, when a close related virus to COVID-19 infected the world, it took a whole month for scientists to sequence its genes. Today, it took the scientists about 10 days from the first case report to sequence the virus genome. Since January, over 23,000 papers written about COVID-19 have been published. Many of these scientific articles are available to view online. I personally have engaged in a dozen online conference calls about COVID-19 providing by FDA, Johns Hopkins University, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Clindata Insights. The amount of information and the work that scientists around the world have put in to find a cure, a vaccine, and to put an end to COVID-19 has been extraordinary. Labs around the world collaborate with each other and help to achieve a “global” goal, fight COVID-19.
