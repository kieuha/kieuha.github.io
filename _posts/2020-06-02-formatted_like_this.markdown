Why Data Science?

My background is in biotech. I spent a couple of years in the Research and Development department at a medical device company that made drug test kits. My job was to collect data for applications to the FDA so that the kits could be used commercially. I did data analysis involving precision, accuracy, linearity to predict behavior in diluted samples, comparison to trusted methods, measure shelf-life, and more. A single study could take years to complete and be done at facilities across the world. These studies are very expensive and time-consuming and don't always get approved by the FDA. It is therefore important to do thorough pre-validation studies to design the formulation that will likely survive the full-on validation. I've always felt that these companies have massive amounts of data that could be useful to build models that better predict the outcomes of future validations. This is just one example where biotech has not caught up with the most modern data science methods. I believe there are more.
